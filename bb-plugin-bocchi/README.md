# bb-plugin-bocchi

A BB plugin that keeps a todo list. It shows every surface a plugin can own:

- `server.ts` — the backend: a todo store in `bb.storage.kv`, RPC methods
  for the page, a `bb bocchi` CLI command, a setting, and a realtime signal
  that keeps every open page current.
- `app.tsx` — the frontend: an **Example todos** page in the left sidebar
  (`app.slots.navPanel`) built from the vendored components.
- `skills/example-todos/SKILL.md` — a skill that tells agents how to keep the list
  with `bb bocchi`. BB imports it into agent threads automatically.

Try it: install the plugin, open **Example todos** in the sidebar, then run
`bb bocchi add "Ship it"` in a terminal. The page updates at once.

## UI components

`components/ui/` is vendored source you own (the shadcn model): edit the
files freely — they never update out from under you. Add more from the BB
component registry (the full shadcn set, version-matched to your BB install
via the pinned ref in `components.json`):

```
npx shadcn add @bb/select @bb/table
```

Run `npm install` once before `bb plugin build` — the vendored components'
npm deps bundle into your dist. React, and BB-shimmed packages like the
radix portal primitives and `sonner` (`import { toast } from "sonner"`
reaches BB's own toaster), are provided by the BB app at runtime and never
bundled. Every shimmed package is declared in `devDependencies` at the
host's version so those imports typecheck; keep them there (never in
`dependencies`, which would bundle a second copy), and `bb plugin types`
repins them alongside the SDK. Ship `dist/` (npm tarball or committed for
git installs) so people installing your plugin never need npm.

## Manifest

`package.json` is the plugin manifest. Notable fields:

- `bb.server` — backend entry (required).
- `bb.app` — frontend entry. Delete it, `app.tsx`, `components/`,
  `hooks/`, and `lib/` for a headless plugin.
- `bb.skills` — skill roots; omitted here, so BB reads `skills/`. Each
  directory with a `SKILL.md` is one skill, named after the directory.
- `bb.name` and `bb.description` — required human-facing identity.
- `bb.branding` — required; declare `icon` as a BB icon name or a
  plugin-relative compact SVG, or declare `logo.light` (with optional
  `logo.dark`). Logo assets must be relative `.svg`, `.png`, or
  `.webp` files.
- `engines.bb` — supported bb app version range.
- `engines.bbPluginSdk` — the lowest plugin SDK you need (scaffold:
  `>=0.4.21`). BB reads this as a floor, not a ceiling: a later
  SDK in the same major still loads your plugin.
- `dependencies` — every package your source imports that BB does not provide.
  `bb plugin build` inlines them into `dist/`, and git installs resolve this
  list alone, so a build-required package here rather than in
  `devDependencies` is what keeps your plugin installable. `devDependencies`
  is for types and tooling only (BB shims React, the portal primitives, and
  `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` at runtime — never bundle them).

Run `bb plugin build` before publishing git/npm installs. It writes
`dist/server.js` + `server.meta.json` and `app.js` / `app.css` /
`app.meta.json`. Each `*.meta.json` stamps SDK major/version,
`artifactFormatVersion`, `pluginId`, `pluginVersion`, and
`builtWith` so managed installs can verify the artifacts.

## Install

From this directory (`bb plugin new` already ran the install; a fresh clone
needs it):

```
npm install
bb plugin install .
```

After editing sources, reload:

```
bb plugin reload bocchi
```

Or let `bb plugin dev` rebuild and reload on every save.

## Configure

```
bb plugin config bocchi
bb plugin config bocchi set showDone false
bb plugin reload bocchi
```

## Types & API reference

The plugin API ships as the npm package `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`, pinned to an
exact version in `devDependencies` (`0.4.21` — the SDK of the BB
that scaffolded this plugin). After `npm install`, the full surface is on disk
at:

```
node_modules/@get-bb/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/bb-plugin-sdk.d.ts      # backend
node_modules/@get-bb/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/bb-plugin-sdk-app.d.ts  # frontend
```

Your editor and `tsc` resolve `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` there through ordinary node
resolution — no path mapping. These are readable declarations: open them for an
exact signature.

The SDK surface grows with every BB release, so the pin has to track the BB you
actually run:

```
bb plugin types          # sync this plugin's SDK surface to the running BB
bb plugin types --check  # CI: fail when it does not match
```

Ask BB to write plugins for you: the `bb-plugin-authoring` skill documents
the whole surface with examples.

Confused by the API, or need something the types don't explain? Clone the BB
repo and read the source: <https://github.com/get-bb/bb>.
